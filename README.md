# hello-world
Another repository sees the light, I guess GitHub is littered with accounts like this, enthusiastic wannabe's with unclear commitment.
Anyways, I'm a research analyst with an background in the humanities, philosophy, ethics, political economy and anthropology. People like me need to get more fluent and involved in coding and developing. 
So that's the mission statement I guess.
